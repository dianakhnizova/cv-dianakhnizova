  titleDescription:
    "I’m striving to grow as a frontend developer because I’m truly inspired by the combination of visual thinking, code, and user interaction. I enjoy creating clear and visually appealing interfaces that solve real-world problems. Currently, I’m actively learning modern technologies such as React, TypeScript, CSS Modules, responsive layout techniques, and working with animations. I want to deepen my knowledge, strengthen my understanding of application architecture, and learn to build complex yet maintainable and high-performance interfaces. My goal is to become a strong frontend developer.",
